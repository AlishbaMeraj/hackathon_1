# ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics Education

## Welcome to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

This educational resource is designed for AI students and developers entering the field of humanoid robotics. Here you will learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for robots.

### Target Audience

This course is specifically designed for:
- AI and robotics students
- Software developers transitioning to robotics
- Researchers working with humanoid robots

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of software architecture concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

### What You'll Learn

In Module 1: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)", you will learn:
- The fundamentals of ROS 2 and its role in humanoid robotics
- How ROS 2 enables communication between robot components
- How to describe robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

### Course Structure

This course is organized into modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of ROS 2 for humanoid robotics:
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Core concepts and communication
- More modules coming soon...

Navigate to the Module 1 section to begin your journey into ROS 2 for humanoid robotics.
