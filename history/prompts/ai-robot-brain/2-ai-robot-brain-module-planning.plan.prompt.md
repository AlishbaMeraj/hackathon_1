  module 3: Module: 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
  - Set up Module-3 in Docusaurus with structured chapters.
  - Create 3 chapters as .md files:
         1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim photorealistic simulation
         2. Isaac ROS for VSLAM and Navigation
         3. Nav2 path planning for humanoid robots
response_text: |
  Created comprehensive implementation plan for AI-Robot Brain module.
  The plan includes:
  - Technical context defining Markdown/Docusaurus approach
  - Constitution check confirming compliance with project principles
  - Project structure for documentation module
  - Research document covering all three chapters with technical decisions
  - Data model defining conceptual entities for the documentation
  - Quickstart guide for users
  - Documentation API contract defining structure and requirements
  - Agent context updated with new technology stack information
outcome: "Implementation plan successfully created with all required artifacts"
evaluation: "Plan addresses all requirements and is ready for task breakdown phase"
