# Introduction to AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module, a comprehensive educational resource focused on NVIDIA Isaac for humanoid robot perception, navigation, and training. This module provides in-depth coverage of three critical areas that form the foundation of modern AI-powered robotics:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Explore photorealistic simulation capabilities and synthetic data generation for robot training
2. **Isaac ROS**: Understand hardware-accelerated perception and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts
3. **Navigation with Nav2**: Master path planning concepts and humanoid navigation basics

This module is designed for AI/Robotics students familiar with ROS 2 and simulation concepts, with a focus on conceptual understanding rather than extensive code examples.
